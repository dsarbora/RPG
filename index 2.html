  <p>Hello players and welcome (when you eventually read this)... You are approached by three creatures of small stature. All similar in appearance, but each has a different symbol inscribed upon their "face" in a clumsy manner. If you were to guess you would assume it was probably done by a small child. One of the creatures approaches, and in a combined voice they say, "We are so glad we found you, we are here to deliver a message. Your response is requested immediately. We will await your response. "</p>

<p>Dear Travelers of Great Renown,<br>
  My name is Sir Jerroth of Stone Lake Keep, first officer to the Lady Hillinder of Stone Lake Keep. It is in these dire circumstances that I request your help. The Lady has been taken captive, and I stand accused of this horrible deed. I honorably await my trial, for I know that I remain innocent, but while I sit here waiting for judgement to fall, Lady Hillinder is taken farther from the safety of the keep.<br><br>
  Please dear travelers, if you are the ones from the great tales, only you can help get her back. The Lady's captors were fleet of foot, but they seem to be slow of wit. Before I was detained I had enough time to write this message and hopefully leave a clue that could lead you to where she is being kept. Unfortunatley I did not have time to analyze the object in question, but if you are as great as the stories imply, it should be but a simple task.<br><br>
  Again I implore you brave travelers, find the Lady Hillinder and rescue her from this great peril.<br><br>
  Regards,<br>
  Sir Jerroth</p>
